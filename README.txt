Contents of the SDK

1) Amazon WebView API (AWV) is a Chromium-derived web runtime exclusive to Fire OS. A drop-in replacement for the WebView that comes with Android devices, AWV makes it possible to create better performing and more powerful hybrid web apps by providing support for a faster JavaScript engine, remote debugging, and hardware optimizations for Kindle Fire devices including an accelerated 2D Canvas, and access to HTML5 features not supported by the built in WebView on Android such as: CSS Calc, Form Validation, getUserMedia, IndexedDB, Web Workers, WebSockets and WebGL.

Please see https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/platforms/android-fireos/docs/building-and-testing-your-hybrid-app on how to build hybrid apps for Fire OS using Amazon WebView.

2) Dynamic Perspective UI for Cordova Apps
